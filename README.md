# GearPlus ResourcePack for Minecraft

GearPlus is a Minecraft resource pack that leverages [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/) features to add alternative models and textures to vanilla items. This lets you essentially expand the number of items you have available in an adventure map or a vanilla server. Custom items will be visible to anyone using GearPlus resource pack.

## Using the pack from GitHub

To use the latest version available on GitHub, you can clone the repository directly to your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder and it should appear in-game. Optionally, you can also double click the `build.bat` to generate a .zip file that should also appear in-game.
